;;; Commentary:

;; To interactively toggle the mode on / off:
;;
;;     M-x smooth-scrolling-mode
;;
;; To make the mode permanent, put this in your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'smooth-scrolling)
;;     (smooth-scrolling-mode 1)
;;
;; This package offers a global minor mode which make emacs scroll
;; smoothly.  It keeps the point away from the top and bottom of the
;; current buffer's window in order to keep lines of context around
;; the point visible as much as possible, whilst minimising the
;; frequency of sudden scroll jumps which are visually confusing.
;;
;; This is a nice alternative to all the native `scroll-*` custom
;; variables, which unfortunately cannot provide this functionality
;; perfectly.  For example, when using the built-in variables, clicking
;; with the mouse in the margin will immediately scroll the window to
;; maintain the margin, so the text that you clicked on will no longer be
;; under the mouse.  This can be disorienting.  In contrast, this mode
;; will not do any scrolling until you actually move up or down a line.
;;
;; Also, the built-in margin code does not interact well with small
;; windows.  If the margin is more than half the window height, you get
;; some weird behavior, because the point is always hitting both the top
;; and bottom margins.  This package auto-adjusts the margin in each
;; buffer to never exceed half the window height, so the top and bottom
;; margins never overlap.

;; See the README.md for more details.

;;; Change Log:
;; 27 Feb 2016 -- v2.0.0
;;      * Converted to global minor mode "smooth-scrolling-mode". This
;;        means that simply loading the file no longer enables smooth
;;        scrolling; you must also enable the mode.
;;      * Internal code restructuring that should improve some edge
;;        cases, but otherwise have no user-visible effects.
;; 19 Dec 2013 -- v1.0.4
;;      * Disabled scrolling while a keyboard macro is executing in
;;        order to prevent a premature termination of the macro by
;;        the mode throwing an error such as "End of Buffer"
;; 02 Jun 2013 -- v1.0.3
;;      * Fixed Issue #3 where bounds checking was not being performed
;;        prior to calls to 'count-lines' and 'count-screen-lines'
;;        functions.
;; 14 Apr 2013 -- v1.0.2
;;      * Adam Spiers GitHub account now houses the canonical
;;        repository.
;; 06 Dec 2011 -- v1.0.1
;;	* Altered structure to conform to package.el standards.
;;	* Restructured code to group settings changes
;;	* Set "redisplay-dont-pause" to true.
;; ?? ??? 2007 -- v1.0.0
;;      * Original version from Adam Spiers

  "Number of lines of visible margin at the top and bottom of a window.
If the point is within these margins, then scrolling will occur
smoothly for `previous-line' at the top of the window, and for
`next-line' at the bottom.

This is very similar in its goal to `scroll-margin'.  However, it
is implemented by activating `smooth-scroll-down' and
`smooth-scroll-up' advise via `defadvice' for `previous-line' and
`next-line' respectively.  As a result it avoids problems
afflicting `scroll-margin', such as a sudden jump and unexpected
highlighting of a region when the mouse is clicked in the margin.

Scrolling only occurs when the point is closer to the window
boundary it is heading for (top or bottom) than the middle of the
window.  This is to intelligently handle the case where the
margins cover the whole buffer (e.g. `smooth-scroll-margin' set
to 5 and `window-height' returning 10 or less).

See also `smooth-scroll-strict-margins'."

(defcustom smooth-scroll-strict-margins t
  "If true, the advice code supporting `smooth-scroll-margin'
will use `count-screen-lines' to determine the number of
*visible* lines between the point and the window top/bottom,
rather than `count-lines' which obtains the number of actual
newlines.  This is because there might be extra newlines hidden
by a mode such as folding-mode, outline-mode, org-mode etc., or
fewer due to very long lines being displayed wrapped when
`truncate-lines' is nil.

However, using `count-screen-lines' can supposedly cause
performance issues in buffers with extremely long lines.  Setting
`cache-long-line-scans' may be able to address this;
alternatively you can set this variable to nil so that the advice
code uses `count-lines', and put up with the fact that sometimes
the point will be allowed to stray into the margin."
